## Description
The Tech Blog is a platform that allows users to create and post blogs about pretty much anything they want. Users are also able to comment on other user's blog posts.

## Installation
The Tech Blog can be accessed at the following link: 

## Usage
When first launching visiting the site, the user will not be able to see any blog posts. Clicking on the dashboard will prompt the user to log in. The user must login or create an account in order to view all blog posts.

When a user has created an account, they have access to the dashboard which gives them the ability to create their own blog post and viewing all blog posts they've created.

Clicking on a blog post will take the user to the a page where they can view the post along with comments that are associated with the post. Viewing posts that belong to the user will display two buttons that will allow them to delete or update their post. Users cannot delete or update other user's posts.
